        <p>Building good credit is essential for financial health and can be achieved through several key practices. Firstly, always pay your bills on time, as payment history is a significant factor in credit scoring. Secondly, keep your credit card balances low in relation to your total credit limits; this is known as credit utilization. Additionally, avoid opening too many new credit accounts at once, as this can lower your average account age and affect your score negatively. Regularly checking your credit reports for inaccuracies and disputing any errors can also help maintain a good credit score. Finally, diversifying your credit accounts by having a mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, and mortgage loans can positively impact your credit score.</p>
